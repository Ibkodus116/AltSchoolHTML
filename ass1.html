          Hi, my name is Ibukun. I am passionate about learning and exploring
          technology. My journey in the tech world have not been straightforward
          so far. I have faced challenges and setbacks, but each experience has
          reinforced my determination to pursue a career in technology. My
          decision to join AltSchool is due to my strong desire to develop my
          own technical skills and establish myself as a key contributor to the
          global tech space. AltSchool has proved to me that it can provided me
          with invaluable resources and mentorship need, to push me to learn,
          adapt, and be prepared for the ever-evolving tech world. Joining
          AltSchool has given me the confidence to embrace new challenges and I
          am willing to learn the skills needed to overcome them. I look forward
          to the next 12 month with so much optimism.
